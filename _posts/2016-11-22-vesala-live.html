<p>Nearly three months after, I finally post here the photos of the Vesala gigs I saw in September. I travelled to Helsinki on purpose to finally see her live (I've been a fan for over ten years now).</p>

<p>This woman is unstoppable: music, theatre, acting, writing. Like <a href="http://dailybruin.com/2016/11/22/finnish-voice-actress-student-paula-vesala-debuts-original-play/">she said, she can do whatever she wants</a> and that is exactly what I want for myself too. I don't want to stop: doesn't matter if it is as developer or not.</p>
<p>And why am I posting this? <a href="http://vesala.la/">Vesala</a> comes to my mind in every job interview I go to and the interviewer asks "why did you become a developer?". Well, over ten years ago I taught myself how to program and I built a small website about her, because she is who I admired a lot at the time (and I still do).</p>

<p>my first websites were about PMMP (around 2005)</p>
<img class="post-image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/22_11_2017/paula_vesala_fan_sites.jpg" alt="paula_vesala"/><p>the only screenshots I was able to recover from ten years ago when I built a fansite about Vesala</p>
<p>I have on my drafts a very long post that will cover how I first learned to program, but for now I will leave here these. I do smile a lot looking at these screenshots: I was 15 years old and I was learning CSS and HTML on my own after school.</p>
<p>And ten years later, I was meeting one of the people that, by accident, contributed a lot to how my future was being shaped at the time.<br />
So thank you Paula, and sorry for crying when I met you.</p>

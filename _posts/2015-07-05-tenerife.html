<p>Finally, after three months, we took a week off. We weren't very ambitious in the destination especially because there were some rules we had to follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>somewhere hot (with beach);</li>
<li>close and in europe (it was just a week so it couldn't be a long flight);</li>
<li>somewhere that allowed us to travel from London to Porto and from Porto to that destination and then back to London (we prefer Gatwick airport);</li>
</ul>
<p>We chose Tenerife. I didn't have high expectations of exploring a lot and the plan was somewhere quiet to relax, rest, read a lot and maybe tan a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>Porto</strong></p>

<p>We were less than 24h in Porto to see some friends and family. There was barely any time to see everyone I wanted to see but it was enough to ease my heart. (funny that I struggled to translate this bit because in my portuguese version I use the word <em>saudade</em> that doesn't have an english translation).</p>
<p>I think i've mentioned before how I am sensitive to smells. This time it wasn't different: as soon as we landed in Porto, arriving to the town were I grew up and smell the ocean made me miss it so much. While I lived there I didn't go to the beach that much but now I do miss feeling the sand between my toes and to find shells.</p>

<p><strong>Tenerife</strong></p>
<p>I didn't take as many pictures as I would had liked. In the end I wasn't really comfortable with carrying my camera to the beach so most of the photos were taken with my mobile phone. The weather was nice and the water... was a bit too cold but without waves :)</p>

<p>The only time we were in an actual beach was in Playa del Camisón. While walking south you will find Playa das Américas and Playa de los Cristianos, all pretty popular. The sand's color is a mix of white sand with volcanic black sand and, walking towards north you will find only volcanic sand beaches (it was the first time that i've been in one).</p>
<p><strong>Vulcano - Mount Teide </strong></p>

<p>The guide took us into the crater to where we could use a lift (which on that day was closed because of the wind) and some popular rock formations. In the second picture, according to the information panel, it is a popular rock formation that resembles a shoe. Interestingly we found that it looked like a sea horse :) It was a pleasant experience but I wouldn't recommend doing it in the afternoon since the heat can become unbearable.</p>

<p>I didn't edit the photos taken near the vulcano because I thought the sky color was great and very blue :)</p>

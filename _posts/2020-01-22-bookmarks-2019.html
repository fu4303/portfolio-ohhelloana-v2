<p>My last bookmark post was in July 2019 and that is quite telling of how things didn't go so well last year for me. At the time, I told myself that I would try to do a bookmark post every month and it all came crashing down around that time. It was in September that I think that I officially burned out. So actually, this will not be a very long collection: I wasn't browsing or reading much and I spent a lot of time offline.</p>

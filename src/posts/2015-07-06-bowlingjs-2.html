<p>There is plenty to do here in London! What I lack is energy after work. Meet ups! I love meet ups. I have published about some meet ups in this blog in the past and when I moved to London I was looking forward to attend them. Sadly I don't have time or energy for all the daily activities and sometimes the desire to just arrive home is bigger.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, before I went on holidays, I went to <a href="http://bowlingjs.github.io/"  >BowlingJS</a>, this time in Elephant &amp; Castle and the same says it all: bowling and meet more people to like/use javascript.</p>
<p>We were a very small group but a really fun crowd... and hey... I only finished last on the first game!</p>
<p>Inês Teles shared a photo of the group in <a href="https://twitter.com/iteles/status/611639759333662720"  >Twitter</a></p>

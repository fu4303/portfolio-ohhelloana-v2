  One of the greatest advantages of living in London is how easier it gets to travel anywhere else. Every time I travelled from Portugal, I knew that it would take at least two hours so imagine how happy I got when I realised my flight to Amsterdam would only take 45 minutes.

  This was all arranged very last minute and it was all so that I could spend at least a day with my best friends from Portugal (who I haven't seen in too long).

<p>I've already visited Amsterdam before but I still made sure that I had a map of the city in my phone (an offline version). In the very first hours of walking, all the streets look the same so it's easy to get lost.</p>

<p>And of course... I visited the cat museum again.</p>

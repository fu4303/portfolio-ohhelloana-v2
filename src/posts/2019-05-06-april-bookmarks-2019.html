<p>April was an interesting month. This year hasn't been great for me because, for the first time, I really can't control my anxiety. Everything I can't control have been draining me in a way that I never experienced before. Those close to me know I've been struggling a lot daily and it sucks. This month I took nearly two weeks off from work and it made me realise how much anxiety I have on a normal day. While I was on holidays I barely used social media or the news and to no one's surprise, my anxiety went down by a lot. And guess what? I didn't miss out much on tech. Was a new shiny tech thing out? Cool, I will look at it when and if I need it.</p>

  <blockquote cite="https://char.gd/blog/2019/you-dont-need-that-hipster-web-framework">
    <p>But, this has all made me wonder: has the modern stack killed experimentation, and shipping bad ideas? Do weird experiments and fun ideas die on the floor, tangled in complexity, more often now? I'd hazard a guess that the answer is yes, and that you should probably skip that hipster framework—for now—as well. Just ship something instead.</p>

<h3>Things that made me smile one way or another</h3>

<p>I need to re-think this section. I really see and save a lot of memes per month on Instagram and TikTok. Not sure if all memes are worth sharing but I'd like this to be a "interesting/wholesome" section.</p>

<p>I feel nothing but anxiety at the moment. I have little energy to describe what I am feeling and explaining why everything is bad regarding Brexit. But I have one note that has been bothering me. Whenever I tell people that I am worried about Brexit, the response is usually: “don’t worry, you will be fine”.</p>

<p>In the past two years, when there are discussions about Brexit and how its campaign was around immigration, and when I tell people that I am an immigrant and it affects me, I hear back “yes but you’re one of the good ones and this wasn’t about people like you”.</p>

<p>As well meant as it can be, I need people to understand how dehumanising this statement is. To me, it means that in “their eyes” I’m still “one of them” but accepted because I’m “good”.</p>

<p>This is what “good” means: I speak English, I always had a job, I don’t claim benefits or use the NHS. This is what people perceive “as a good immigrant”. All this plus my skin colour and country of origin privilege.</p>

<p>For the past two years I’ve been biting my tongue but all I want to ask you is: what happens when I stop being a “good one”?</p>

<p>What happens when and if I have an accident and may not be able to work ever again?</p>

<p>What happens when and if I have children and I need support?</p>

<p>What happens when I get older and need to use the NHS?</p>

<p>Is this my new status of constant probation? I am not fine. I am worried for everyone. I need people to stop telling me to stop worrying. Everyone who says this has absolute no experience in discrimination or exposure to the lengths people go to hurt other humans. </p>

<p>P.S.: I hope it is implied that I don’t believe in the concept of “good” or “bad” immigrants and I don’t believe “I am one of the good ones”. Please don’t bother arguing with me and denying that the campaign was mostly about immigration.</p>

<p>When this month started I was very optimistic. I was full of energy and keen to get shit done. Now, I am overwhelmed with this sense of productivity shame. I have two blog posts that are still on my drafts, one side project and a lot of other tasks to do. Hopefully next month it will be better. </p>

Black Lives Matter. 

I'm Portuguese - when I went to school I wasn't taught what my country actually did during "discoveries". Where I grew up, we pretend our society isn't racist because there is no physical violence. In today's age with today's resources there is no excuse not to educate yourself and see how we're in a racist society. 

Follow the folks who talk about racial injustice. Think how the technology we're building is tracking and tracing everyone who is protesting. Learn about data regulations. Learn the tricks of the media. 

Here's a couple of things I saved. However, I urge you all to please diversify the feeds you consume.
